The concept of "Block List" probably needs to be included into the TranslatorTestingModel. A Block List is to a Test Asset what a Test Suite is to a Test Case... just some kind of (user meaningful) aggregation of the underlying test entity concerned.

Perhaps ad hoc (user) tagging of Test Assets might also be equivalent or complementary to the block list idea, that is, one simply tags TestAssets to specify a list of such assets which is a "block list". This tagging of sets of Test Assets defining "Block Lists" could, in principle, be done from the Test Manager UI... If the TestRunners need to know about a list of related TestAssets, then the model needs to know about it!  

Clarification of the difference between a Test Asset and Test Case.

a Test Case is an operationalized "Test Asset instantiated with a comparison (code)" for running in a Test Runner.

That said, an "Expected Output" column in the Test Assets does feel somewhat like a 'comparison' in abstract(?).

Back to the Test Harness / Test Manager: two modes of test running:

1. A (text) specification/declaration of a Test Suite sitting on a server, automatically read by the Test Harness (triggered automatically by a cron job to periodically run).

2. A user composing ("one of", "ad hoc") a Test Suite specification while sitting in front of the "Test Manager" UI or somehow calling the "Test Manager" API, with such a specification

Of course, the two modes become blurred if the Test Manager UI is used to create a Test Suite which the Test Harness is then instructed to periodically run automatically
